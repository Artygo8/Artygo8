# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Arthur Gossuin.

## About me

 - I started learning about code in 2019 school 19 (network 42). :nerd_face:
 - I am a big fan of coding contests. :trophy:
 - I love simple - readable - beautiful code. :butterfly:	
 - I love Algorithms. 	:heart_eyes:
 - I like C++ or even C, but Python is so easy that I almost always pick this language... :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
